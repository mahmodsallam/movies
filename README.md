# movies
## Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

This app uses the API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## Why this project 

To become an Flutter developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Flutter. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.
