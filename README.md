## Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you‚Äôll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

This app uses the API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
 
## Why this project

Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices.
